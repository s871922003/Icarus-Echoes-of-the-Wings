----> All the house/building parts are organized as tiles, but you can also use it as sprites and I recommend you to use as sprites too so you can
build your building more easily without the tile grid constraint

-Check walls1 spritesheet to know how the modular parts are setup. The rest of the spritesheets (walls2, 3, etc) follow the exact same pattern/positioning

-->The watermill mockup uses a shorter roof intersection. Currently roof intersections only support roofs with 10 tiles width. The roof intersections
for the shorter roofs will come in the updates eventually. This is only needed for the front view roof version.
